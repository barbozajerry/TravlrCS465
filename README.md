<h3>Architecture</h3>
Express provides us with a simple and consistent interface for directing an incoming URL to some code that can serve as a static HTML page, read from a database, write to a database and more. Express also allows us to become faster since its interface is simple and consistent. Express also reuses components and data from the application where it compiles them and sends it to the browser as HTML. Also Express is the server-side framework while Angular is the client-side framework that allows building entire applications that run in the browser. Some advantages of SPA functionality are that itâ€™s very fast and it sends an HTML file on the first request and sends JSON data on subsequent requests. It also dynamically updates the content after loading the single HTML page while the user interacts with the application. Some of the disadvantages of SPA is that it uses a lot of browser resources and has security issues since attackers/hackers can inject client-side scripts directly into the web applications.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<br> 
JavaScript is the programming language that brings web pages to life. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), is derived from JavaScript that is used to format object data and making it a lightweight format for storing and tranfering data, for example when data is sent from the server to a web page.
